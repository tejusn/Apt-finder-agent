# Agentic Apartment Finder MVP - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration (Completed)

1.  **Create Project Structure:**
    *   Initialized a new project directory.
    *   Set up essential files: `package.json` (for dependency management if using Node.js), `config.json` (for website configurations and user preferences), and a main agent script file (e.g., `agent.js` or `agent.py` depending on the chosen language).
2.  **Implement Configuration Loading:**
    *   Write code to read and parse the `config.json` file.
    *   Structure the configuration to include:
        *   `max_rent_threshold`:  To store the maximum rent value.
        *   `websites`: An array to hold the URLs of apartment websites to be scraped.
3.  **Basic Logging Setup:**
    *   Integrated a simple logging mechanism to track agent activities and errors. This will be crucial for debugging and monitoring.

## Phase 2: Website Scraping and Data Extraction (Estimated Time: 2-3 days)

1.  **Choose Scraping Library:**
    *   Select an appropriate web scraping library based on the chosen programming language (e.g., `axios` and `cheerio` for Node.js, `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` for Python).
2.  **Implement Website Fetching:**
    *   Write functions to fetch the HTML content of each website listed in the `config.json`.
3.  **Develop Data Extraction Logic:**
    *   Implement functions to parse the HTML and extract relevant information based on the "Detailed Requirements" section of the PRD.
    *   Start with the keyword-based and formatting recognition approach for MVP simplicity.
    *   Focus on extracting: Price, Move-in Date, Square Footage, Apartment Name (if available), and Listing URL.
4.  **Data Structuring:**
    *   Structure the extracted data into a consistent format (e.g., an array of objects or a dictionary) for further processing.

## Phase 3: Listing Alerting and Error Handling (Estimated Time: 2-3 days)

1.  **Implement Listing Filtering:**
    *   Write logic to filter extracted listings based on the user's criteria:
        *   Rent within `max_rent_threshold`.
        *   Move-in date within the specified range (around May 10th +/- 20 days).
2.  **Develop Alerting Mechanism:**
    *   Implement email notifications using a suitable library (e.g., `nodemailer` for Node.js, `smtplib` for Python).
    *   Configure email settings (using Gmail as specified, which might require setting up an App Password or adjusting Gmail security settings).
    *   Format alert emails to include the extracted listing details as outlined in the PRD.
3.  **Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic:**
    *   Wrap scraping and data extraction functions in `try-catch` blocks to handle potential errors.
    *   Implement a retry mechanism for website scraping failures.
    *   Log errors and send email notifications for persistent or critical errors.

## Phase 4: Scheduling and Testing (Estimated Time: 1-2 days)

1.  **Implement Scheduling:**
    *   Set up a scheduling mechanism to run the agent twice daily (6:00 AM and 6:00 PM).
    *   Consider using system's task scheduler (cron on macOS) or a library like `node-cron` if using Node.js.
2.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Test the agent thoroughly, starting with a single website from the configuration.
    *   Manually verify data extraction accuracy and alert generation.
    *   Refine data extraction logic and error handling based on testing results.

## Technology Considerations:

*   **Programming Language:**  Given the project context and common web scraping libraries, JavaScript (Node.js) or Python would be suitable choices. Node.js might be slightly advantageous due to its asynchronous nature for web requests.
*   **Scraping Libraries:** `axios` and `cheerio` (Node.js) or `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` (Python) are excellent options for web scraping and HTML parsing.
*   **Email Library:** `nodemailer` (Node.js) or `smtplib` (Python) for sending email notifications.
*   **Scheduling:** System's task scheduler (cron) or `node-cron` (Node.js).
